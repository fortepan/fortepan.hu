    description: >
      Fortepan Method aims to establish and promote an international digital
      private photo archive of the 20th century with a Creative Commons-based,
      free to use license. The project design is based on experiences of
      Fortepan.hu’s team; this good practice will be further developed and
      transferred to the European level. Our partners in implementing the
      project are [Fundacja Edukacji Wizualnej
      (PL)](https://fotofestiwal.com/2022/en/ "") and [Associazione Culturale
      Photolux (IT)](http://www.photoluxfestival.it/ ""). During the project
      period we are collecting photos throughout Europe, edited images will be
      uploaded to the digital archive. Besides we will organize exhibitions in
      all three countries displaying curated photos collected.
