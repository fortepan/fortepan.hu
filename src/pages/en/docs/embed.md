<h2 id="edit-lists">Editing lists</h2>

You can reach the ["Lists"](https://fortepan.hu/en/lists/) page from the header by clicking on the profile icon:

<h3 id="login-register">1. Login and sign up</h3>

To create and edit custom lists on Fortepan, you will need to log in with an existing user account. If you don't have yours yet, you can create one by signing up in a few simple steps.

{% include image-lazyloader/image-lazyloader.liquid src:"/images/docs/embed/fortepan.hu_docs_embed_en_02.jpg" alt:"Login and sign up" custom_class:"article-img autosize" %}

<h3 id="create-list">2. Creating lists</h3>

When logged in you can create new lists by clicking on the **Create new list** button.

In the appearing window you can edit the name, optionally add a short description, and also set the visibility of the list. Private lists can only be viewed by their owners (when logged in).

You can add photos to the created list from the Fortepan archive by clicking on the **Photos** button (this will take you to the [Photos page](https://fortepan.hu/en/photos/).

{% include image-lazyloader/image-lazyloader.liquid src:"/images/docs/embed/fortepan.hu_docs_embed_en_04.jpg" alt:"Creating lists" custom_class:"article-img autosize" %}

<h3 id="add-photos-to-list">3. Adding photos to lists</h3>

You can add photos to a list from the Fortepan [Photos page](https://fortepan.hu/en/photos/). For this you will need to open the gallery view and click on the **Add to list** icon:

{% include image-lazyloader/image-lazyloader.liquid src:"/images/docs/embed/fortepan.hu_docs_embed_en_05.jpg" alt:"Adding photos to lists" custom_class:"article-img autosize" %}

In the appearing window you can select the list to which you want to add the current photo:

<h3 id="edit-list">4. Editing a list</h3>

#### On the lists page

You will find the options for editing the list in the dropdown that appears by clicking on the **Edit icon** (three dots) next to the name of the list.

#### On the list details page

You will find the options for editing the list in the dropdown that appears by clicking on the **Edit** link.

<h2 id="embed-list">Embedding lists</h2>

Just like content on video-sharing platforms, the lists created on Fortepan can be embedded in the form of a unique gallery on any other website.

<h3 id="embed-example">Example of an embedded list:</h3>

<iframe width="100%"  style="aspect-ratio:16/9;" src="https://fortepan.hu/en/embed/688355" frameborder="0" allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

#### In this guide we only show you how to generate the embed code.

> For embedding lists on other websites, you will need access to the content administration tool or source code of that particular website. If you would like to embed lists on your page, and you're not sure how to do it, please contact your website's developer for assistance.

<h3 id="embed-list-steps">Embedding steps:</h3>

1\. To generate the embed code select the **Embed list** option from the [edit list](#edit-list) dropdown.

{% include image-lazyloader/image-lazyloader.liquid src:"/images/docs/embed/fortepan.hu_docs_embed_en_08.jpg" alt:"Editing the list on the list details page" custom_class:"article-img autosize" %}

2\. In the appearing window you can adjust the dimensions of the embedded gallery (width, height, aspect ratio, etc.)

{% include image-lazyloader/image-lazyloader.liquid src:"/images/docs/embed/fortepan.hu_docs_embed_en_09.jpg" alt:"Generate the embed code" custom_class:"article-img autosize" %}

3\. When you're done with setting up the right dimensions, click on the **Copy embed code** button which will copy the code to the clipboard. You can then paste the code directly into your website's content administration tool or source code. (If you're not sure how to do this, please contact your website's developer for assistance.)
