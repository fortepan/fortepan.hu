  blurb: Have a look at 2300 hitherto unknown images from 65 donors in the “Fresh”
    section of Fortepan. If we place the images from family albums and negative rolls
    close to one another, we can sort of stroll along the entire 20th century. Here
    you can find our highly personal selection, the subject of which is human being
    and human passing. Holidays, relocation calamities, uniforms, public and private
    holidays. Transit employees, emigrants, pioneers. Our earlier selves – all this
    once happened to us.

This website was launched in 2010 and it initially contained photographs found randomly in the streets of Budapest. The archive has expanded since then through donations from families, amateur and professional photographers, along with public collections. The images on the website are selected by editors.

The descriptions attached to the images are compiled and edited by volunteers, utilizing information contributed at the Fortepan Forum. We gladly offer to process your photographs and negatives as well, you can contact us at [fortepan@gmail.com](mailto:fortepan@gmail.com).
