  blurb: This time we have uploaded 2200 photos from 22 donors to the Fresh section
    of Fortepan. Apart from the ever familiar amateur photo legacies (ones we can
    never grow tired of), we included images from the oeuvre of two of our pivotally
    important photo journalists, of Zoltán Szalay and Tamás Urbán. Moreover, we selected
    close to 400 photos from the WWI collection of the National Library of Austria.

This website was launched in 2010 and it initially contained photographs found randomly in the streets of Budapest. The archive has expanded since then through donations from families, amateur and professional photographers, along with public collections. The images on the website are selected by editors.

The descriptions attached to the images are compiled and edited by volunteers, utilizing information contributed at the Fortepan Forum. We gladly offer to process your photographs and negatives as well, you can contact us at [fortepan@gmail.com](mailto:fortepan@gmail.com).
