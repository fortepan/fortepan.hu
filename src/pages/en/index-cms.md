  blurb: 'Below you can find the second, concluding part of what we have chosen from
    the FŐFOTO (Municipal Photo Company) archive, the continuation of the spring instalment.
    You’ll find 2200 images, focusing on three subjects: film posters and hand-painted
    film ads on large canvases, advertising and fashion photos from the advent of
    Hungarian advertising photography, street photography block by block, from the
    inner districts of Budapest. Several hundreds of colour photos, on classic modern
    buildings, on products impossible to sell, on clothes difficult not to smile at.
    Professional photos from a DIY world.'

This website was launched in 2010 and it initially contained photographs found randomly in the streets of Budapest. The archive has expanded since then through donations from families, amateur and professional photographers, along with public collections. The images on the website are selected by editors.

The descriptions attached to the images are compiled and edited by volunteers, utilizing information contributed at the Fortepan Forum. We gladly offer to process your photographs and negatives as well, you can contact us at [fortepan@gmail.com](mailto:fortepan@gmail.com).
