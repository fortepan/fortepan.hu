    Every month or two, we update our site with around 2-3000 images, often
    mixing family photos of many donors, but sometimes a photo documentation of
    an author or a company is added to the archive.

This website was launched in 2010 and it initially contained photographs found randomly in the streets of Budapest. The archive has expanded since then through donations from families, amateur and professional photographers, along with public collections. The images on the website are selected by editors.

The descriptions attached to the images are compiled and edited by volunteers, utilizing information contributed at the Fortepan Forum. We gladly offer to process your photographs and negatives as well, you can contact us at [fortepan@gmail.com](mailto:fortepan@gmail.com).
