  blurb: "Sándor Kereki was born in Budapest in 1952 and started photographing at the age of 16. On his images, grotesque as well as emotional scenes come to life from the everyday life of socialist Hungary in the 70s. After fifty years he decided to pulish his images that depict the world of a street photographer focusing primarily on people, special figures and odd characters. From the thousands of negatives taken by him over ten years, we selected 1,850 photographs for Fortepan and we also recommend to check out our hundred favorite Kereki photos."

This website was launched in 2010 and it initially contained photographs found randomly in the streets of Budapest. The archive has expanded since then through donations from families, amateur and professional photographers, along with public collections. The images on the website are selected by editors.

The descriptions attached to the images are compiled and edited by volunteers, utilizing information contributed at the Fortepan Forum. We gladly offer to process your photographs and negatives as well, you can contact us at [fortepan@gmail.com](mailto:fortepan@gmail.com).
